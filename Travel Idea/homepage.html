         <h3>Cultural identity of Sri Lanka</h3>
        <section class="section2">   
           <p>
            Highlands make up Sri Lanka’s south-central region and core, with narrow gorges and deep river valleys. The surrounding lowlands include hills and fertile plains. The developing mixed economy is largely based on agriculture, services, and light industries. Clothing, tea, gemstones, and rubber are exported. The island is world-famous for its gemstones, which include sapphires, rubies, and topaz. It is also a major producer of high-grade graphite. Sri Lanka is a republic with one legislative house; its head of state and government is the president, assisted by the prime minister.
           <br>
           <p>Mostly it has been influenced by its long history and its Buddhist heritage. The country has a rich artistic tradition, embracing the fine arts, including music, dance, and visual arts. Sri Lankan lifestyle is reflected in the cuisine, festivals, and sports. South Indian influences are visible in many aspects.</p>

            <p>
                In 1505 the Portuguese arrived, and by 1619 they controlled most of the island. The Sinhalese enlisted the Dutch to help oust the Portuguese, and the island eventually came under the control of the Dutch East India Company, which relinquished it in 1796 to the British. In 1802 it became the British crown colony of Ceylon, which gained independence in 1948. It became the Republic of Sri Lanka in 1972 and took its present name in 1978.

                Civil strife between Tamil and Sinhalese groups beset the country beginning in the early 1980s, the Tamils demanding a separate autonomous state in northern Sri Lanka. A prolonged insurrection by the Tamil Tigers guerrilla group was defeated by government forces in 2009. In 2004 Sri Lanka was struck by a tsunami that badly damaged much of the coastline and killed tens of thousands of people.

            <p id="para3">Sigiriya is one of the most important urban planning projects of the first millennium. Udawalawe National Park has extensive stretches of grassland as well as scrub jungle and riverine forest. Gal Oya National Park receives fewer visitors than many of the other parks. Yala National Park is Sri Lanka's number one leopard sanctuary. The big cats are thriving here in territories of little more than a kilometre each. Arugam Bay was becoming one of the world's top surf destinations before the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, with its coconut palm-covered point.
